Virus Vanguard is a virus-themed game where survival is the ultimate goal. In this game, players find themselves during an invasion, with infected patients relentlessly attempting to spread the virus to healthy individuals. The player’s mission is clear: either eliminate all infected threats or endure the attacks until a predetermined virus limit is reached. The player must navigate through the chaos and find their loved ones while avoiding infection.

## Levels
The game has two levels. In the first level, the player finds himself in an abandoned city where are full of infected people. In this level, the player should find the hospital and during the traveling, they should also avoid being infected and can kill those people or run away from them. When the player’s health is decreased, they can try to find a pharmacy in the area, and going to the pharmacy makes them healed at a certain amount. At the end of this level, reaching the hospital transitions to the next level, bringing him closer to finding his loved ones.
In the second level, the player enters a hospital and in that area, they should find their loved ones. While trying to find them, they should also avoid being infected and kill the infected people because there is no pharmacy. After the player finds their loved ones, the game is completed successfully.

## How to Play
The game is played by using WASD keys and a mouse. Clicking the mouse makes the character shoot the infected people and moving the mouse to the sides makes the character rotate around.  WASD keys make the character go forward, backward, left, and right
